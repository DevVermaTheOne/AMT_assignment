This is my assignment for selection for Artificial Intelligence internship at animemangatoon.com

I would recommend running this in the terminal directory after creating a new virtual environment within this directory:
>>pip install requirements.txt

Task 1:
    I used a kaggle dataset named "webtoon_data.csv" to train a DecisionTreeClassifier and a Logistic Regression model after
    vectorizing the data using different methods

Task 2:
    Used beautiful-soup to scrape the comments from the website and then ran a sentiment analysis on it using TextBlob

Task 3:
    Scraped data from the given webpage to gather information and made a basic chatbot using cosine_similarity. Answers
    will be better when more detailed and specific questions are asked
